VTK Filters
===========

In addition to the command-line interface, mesh-doctor functionality is also available as VTK filters for programmatic use in Python. These filters provide the same mesh validation and processing capabilities but can be integrated directly into Python workflows and visualization pipelines.

The VTK filters offer several advantages:

* **Integration**: Easy integration with existing VTK/ParaView workflows
* **Scripting**: Programmatic access for batch processing and automation
* **Visualization**: Direct output suitable for ParaView visualization
* **Flexibility**: Configurable parameters and output options
* **Chaining**: Ability to combine multiple filters in processing pipelines
