Solvers
=======

These classes were developed to help the user control the execution of the solver used in their simulation and to handle
certain pygeos wrappers easily. Depending on the specifics of the solver targeted, methods have been added to acces the
values of GEOS fields and create outputs of different formats.

The base class for every other solver class is called ``Solver``.
