Welcome to the GEOS Python Package Repository!
-----------------------------------------------

This repository contains a set of python packages that are used alongside [GEOS](https://github.com/GEOS-DEV/GEOS).
They can be installed automatically by running "make geosx_python_tools" in the GEOS build directory, or can be installed manually with pip.
See the [documentation](https://geosx-geosx.readthedocs-hosted.com/projects/geosx-geospythonpackages/en/latest/) for additional details about the packages and how to use them.
